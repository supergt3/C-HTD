This is the code of C-HTD.

First, unzip MSTAR.rar and tensor_toolbox.rar.

perform test_CCT_HTD.m to test CCT-HTD method, and output the extracted features and the classification accuracy across domains.

perform test_CCT_HTD.m to test CFM-HTD method, and output the extracted features and the accuracy and NMI using paired multisource samples.
